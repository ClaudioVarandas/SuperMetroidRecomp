/* ── Super Metroid host frame driver ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Unlike MMX's 7-slot cooperative scheduler, Super Metroid runs as a
 * single linear program: reset ($80:841C, Vector_RESET) falls into the
 * main game loop ($82:8948, RunOneFrameOfGame in the decomp), which
 * dispatches the current game state and then waits for vblank via
 * WaitForNMI ($80:8338). WaitForNMI is called from arbitrary call depth
 * (game-state handlers, door transitions, cutscenes — see the
 * COROUTINE_AWAIT sites the snesrev/sm decomp threads through it), and
 * reset itself waits on NMI during its boot delays. So the whole game
 * runs on ONE host fiber; WaitForNMI yields it back to the host, the
 * host emulates the frame (NMI + PPU), then resumes the fiber exactly
 * after the yield — preserving the full C call stack the way a fiber
 * does and a longjmp cannot.
 *
 * WaitForNMI ($80:8338) is HLE-replaced (bank00.cfg `hle_func 8338
 * HleSmWaitForNmi`); the HLE body in gen_stubs.c calls sm_host_yield(). */

/* Saved architectural register file across a fiber switch. g_cpu is a
 * global; the host's I_NMI run and the game's main-line code share it,
 * so each side's 65816 register state must be saved/restored around the
 * SwitchToFiber (same rationale as mmx_rtl.c's per-slot CpuState save —
 * runtime-flag-gated codegen reads m_flag/x_flag widths). */
